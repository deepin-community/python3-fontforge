 PREAMBLE
 .
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are
 to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects,
 to support the font creation efforts
 of academic and linguistic communities,
 and to provide a free and open framework
 in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts
 to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely
 as long as they are not sold by themselves.
 The fonts, including any derivative works,
 can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software
 provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works.
 The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
 under any other type of license.
 The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
 does not apply to any document
 created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .

 by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license
